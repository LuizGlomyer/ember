# EMBER

An access control system that I made as final project proposal for my Information Systems course. It uses a Raspberry Pi to act as a mediator to allow or deny access to computational resources via a RFID card.

EMBER means **E**ntry **M**ediated by **B**lockchain, **E**thereum and **R**aspberry
(originally *Entrada Mediada por Blockchain, Ethereum e Raspberry*, in brazillian portuguese). Saddly the project proposal did not pass, so the code does not contemplate the Blockchain aspect of the project. However, the access control system is fully functional.

Here is a video demonstration of the project (in brazillian portuguese):
